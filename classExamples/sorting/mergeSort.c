    Merge Sort

        * splits in two blocks, merge sorted blocks
        * sort (n/2)
        * sort (n/2)
        * merge 
    
        time complexity
            M(n) = 2M(n/2)  (add here)

            add these to the end for...
            best - N/2 (one side empty)
            worst - n-1

            however can just say its N (basically the same)

            M(n) = 2M(n/2) + n
