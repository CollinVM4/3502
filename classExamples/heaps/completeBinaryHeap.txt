complete binary heap

    * when using priority queue, removals go as such
    * take highest priorty node, swap with bottom node
    * "percolate" nodes below and see if they meet criteria for swap


    How to avoid nodes

    * use an array, mark index of each "node"

            0      <- arr[0]
           / \
          1   2    <- arr[1],arr[2]


          to find left child = 2i + 1
          to find right child = 2i + 2  


          parent of node I = (I - 1)/2  <- integer division a
