Priority Queue 

    functions:
        add - give priority when adding
        remove - always highest priority
        front - pull highest priority

    "Abstract Data Type"
        * can be implemented in a number of ways
            1. linked list - 
                 * highest priority = head
                 * must be sorted
                 * avg. insertion = O(N) BAD 
            2. BST - 
                * avg. insertion = O(log(N))
                * front = maximum left/right value

                avl implementation
                    best/avg/worst
                    insertion       logN
                    remove          logN
                    front           logN

            3. Heap - 
                * ever node is the higest priority of its subtree
                * root has the higest priority over everything
