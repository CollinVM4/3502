algorith analysis notes
x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x

    *  used to compare programs that solve the same problem
        - measure
            1. runtime (not wallclock time, instead num of simple operations)
                ie. arithmetic (+,-,/,*,%)
                    binary 
                    equality (!=, ==, <, >, <=, >=)
                    increments (++, --, +=, -=)
                    assignment (a = b)
                    if (branches)
                    dereference (*, ->)

                        note: seeing how the program will grow is called Order Approximation (double input size, double simple operations)


            2. memory
