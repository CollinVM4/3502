Trie function types

    1. Trie Traversal       <-- must be recursive
        ex. printing tree
    2. Path Traversal       <-- can iterative
        ex. contains()



    How could I count # of words that end with 'q'?




    how many nodes are in the trie containing only the words
    Alice 
    Bob 
    Carol 
    Bravo
    Alex
    Car
    Carasol

        1. sort words

            Alex    --> 5 
            Alice   --> 3
            Bob     --> 3
            Bravo   --> 4 
            Car     --> 3 
            Carasol --> 4
            Carol   --> 2 
                        = 24;
