    First Assignment Notes 


    Hill Cipher
    
    * Invented in 1926 by Lester Hill
    * uses Linear Algebra (matrix manipulation)
    * Letters are encoded as numbers modulo 26
    * blocks are interpreted as vectors
    * key is a random matrix of same dimension as vectors
    

    Vectors

    * vector is an ordered set of nums
    * the dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of each component
    ex. 
    [1,5,4] * [4,2,6] = (1)(4) + (5)(2) + (4)(6)
    4 + 10 + 24 = 48

    Matrices
    
    * rectangular arrangement of numerical values 
    * similar to a vector, just an ordered arrangmenet

    How to cipher
    * key vector * plaintext vector, output mod 26 = ciphertext
